This is my take on the weather-app challenge of freecodecamp.org's. The
plan is to add some more functionality.

See the app live on: https://tonnerkiller.de/weather.app/

You will have to add an exception to your browser, as I have a custom
github page and the ssl only works for *.github.io pages.
But we need ssl encryption as this app uses the html5 geolocation
functionality which requires https.


This started as a CodePen pen, see earlier version here:
